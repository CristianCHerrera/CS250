- How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
User stories help interpret the user needs by allowing the developers to think of how a user might navigate through their program. Since 
a program that's created by never be used by the developer themselves, they might need insight as to what is expected.

- How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I would approach developing programs through the lens of the end user, and by thinking through what features or elements a program 
or application would require to fit their needs. Through user stories, a product backlog can be created to ensure that the requirements 
of the client are met and the wants of the user are as well.

- What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
A good team member in software development is one that has as good of communication skills as they do technical skills. They should be 
competent enough to be able to perfrom their part of a project, but they should also be able to communicate with the team if issues arise, or
be there to help others with their expertise when needed.
